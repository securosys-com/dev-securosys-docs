# Getting started with Keyfactor EJBCA

The quickstart section provides a comprehensive guide outlining the steps necessary to integrate [Keyfactor/PrimeKey EJBCA](https://www.keyfactor.com/) with Securosys [CloudHSM](../cloudhsm/overview) or on-premises Primus HSM.

## Installing & Configuring Primus PKCS#11 Provider

Install the latest version of Primus [PKCS#11 Provider](../pkcs/overview) on the device with the Keyfactor/PrimeKey EJBCA already installed.

Follow the instructions in [PKCS#11 Provider Installation](/primekey-ejbca/Installation/Provider-setup).

Configure the Primus PKCS#11 provider by adapting the configuration file **`primus.cfg`** according to your set-up. 

:::info
Consult [Primus PKCS#11 User Guide - Configuration](/pkcs/Installation/pkcs11_provider_configuration) for configuration file locations.
:::

## HSM Setup and Configuration 

Follow the instructions provided in [HSM Setup and Configuration](/primekey-ejbca/Installation/Prerequisites#hsm-setup-and-configuration).


## Configure EJBCA Settings

Configure the EJBCA settings to integrate with the Primus PKCS#11 provider. For more information visit [Installation - EJBCA Settings](/primekey-ejbca/Installation#ejbca-property-file)


## Configure New Crypto Token

Deploy the EJBCA with the newly configured settings and Integrate the HSM by [Configuring a New Crypto Token](/primekey-ejbca/Installation/#configure-new-crypto-token).

## Generate RSA Keys

Generate cryptographic objects which will be used by the new Certificate Authority (CA). For more information, see [Keyfactor/PrimeKey EJBCA Documentation](https://doc.primekey.com/ejbca/tutorials-and-guides).

## Create a New Certificate Authority (CA)

Create a new Certificate Authority and configure it with the previously created crypto token and keys.
For more information on EJBCA Certificate Authority setup and best practices, follow [Keyfactor/PrimeKey EJBCA Documentation](https://doc.primekey.com/ejbca/tutorials-and-guides).
