# Azure - Bring Your Own Key

Azure Key Vault is a managed service that enables you to safeguard cryptographic keys and other secrets used by cloud applications and services. With Azure Key Vault, you can easily create, store, and control access to keys used to encrypt your data, as well as secrets such as passwords, API keys, and certificates. Azure Key Vault seamlessly integrates with Azure services and provides a secure and centralized solution for key management.

Azure BYOK (Bring Your Own Key) empowers you with greater control over the lifecycle, security, and durability of your keys. This integration guide illustrates the straightforward process of integrating Securosys CloudHSM (HSM as a Service) or on-premises Primus HSM cluster with Azure Key Vault BYOK. By leveraging secure key generation and storage on the HSM, you can enhance the security of your data and meet regulatory requirements with ease.
