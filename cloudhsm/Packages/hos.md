# HSM Operation Service (HOS)

HSM Operation Service (HOS) is meant for customers who want to maintain full custody by owning the HSM while it’s operated by Securosys.

For more information, please [contact sales](https://www.securosys.com/en/contact).

## Service Description

The client acquires Securosys HSMs including all required options, optional Decanus devices and the selected Maintenance & Support model.
 
Instead of installing the platform on-premises, the client can opt for the HOS service by Securosys for installation of the acquired devices at one or more Securosys CloudHSM datacenters. Securosys then handles administration, updates, monitoring and the internet connectivity in co-ordination with the client.
