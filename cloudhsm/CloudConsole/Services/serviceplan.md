# Service Packages

CloudHSM Service Packages define the type of Hardware Security Modules you can configure and the geographical location.

Securosys CloudHSM Services provisioned through Cloud Console provide access to a single partition per service. For dedicated hardware, please [contact Sales](https://www.securosys.com/en/contact).

See [create a partition](./createapartition.md) for more information about configuring your service partitions.
