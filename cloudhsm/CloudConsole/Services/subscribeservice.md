# Subscribing to a New Service

A tenant administrator may purchase service subscriptions through [Cloud Console](http://cloud.securosys.com/).

Cloud Console offers a **90-day free trial** of the [CloudHSM Sandbox (SBX)](../../Packages/sandbox) service.

# Subscribe to a New Service

To subscribe to a new service, the tenant administrator may:

- **Log** into [Cloud Console](http://cloud.securosys.com/) and go to the page of the service you want to subscribe to.
- **Select** a tenant on the right-hand side, select the parameters you want for your service. Parameters differ from a service to another.
- Click **Checkout** to generate a pricing offer based on the parameters you selected.

:::info
If you would like to subscribe to a service which doesn't have a **checkout** button, please [contact a sales associate](mailto:sales@securosys.com) to explore purchasing options for the service.
:::

- Your information are automatically pre-filled. You can adjust them if necessary.
- Enter your **VAT number** if relevant
- Choose a **payment method** and enter the information requested
- Click **Buy now** to confirm the subscription

Several emails may be sent to you:
- A **confirmation email** is sent with the invoice attached. The invoicing is managed through *MyCommerce DigitalRiver*.
- A **confirmation email** for the free trial
- A **New Service Created email** with a PIN code to retrieve the HSM credentials

Keep the following in mind when subscribing to services through the Cloud Console:
- Each subscription is unique with separate commitments
- If a service is kept after the end of the free trial, it will be converted to a subscription.
- Expired subscriptions do not automatically delete services.

# Activate a new service

Continue with the [CloudHSM activation process](/cloudhsm/GettingStarted/activation_process).
