# Configuration & Management

Securosys manages all modifications to CloudHSM partition parameters upon customer request. These requests can be made through various channels, such as the Order Form or direct communication with the service desk via the [Support Portal](https://support.securosys.com).

Requests through the [Support Portal](https://support.securosys.com) must be submitted or confirmed by a user with the “privileged Support User” role. All requests must be authenticated; therefore, we do not accept phone call requests — only those made through the [Support Portal](https://support.securosys.com).

An alternative option is for subscribers to remotely manage their partitions using the [Decanus Terminal's Partition Administration feature](../Overview/features.md#hsm-partition-remote-administration). This self-service tool empowers subscribers with granular control over their partitions' parameters and functionalities without requiring Securosys's direct intervention.
