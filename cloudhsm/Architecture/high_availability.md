# High Availability, Load Balancing & Disaster Recovery

To ensure the highest levels of redundancy, failover, and load balancing, Securosys employs HSM clusters consisting of a minimum of two and a maximum of four HSMs. The specific cluster configuration is tailored to the chosen CloudHSM [service package](../Packages/overview.md), with dedicated HSM services requiring a customized setup.

### Load Balancing

The Primus API Providerâ€™s intelligent design distributes cryptographic operations randomly across all HSMs in the cluster, ensuring even distribution. This approach optimizes performance and resource utilization while maintaining a strong security posture.

### Data Center Redundancy

Securosys strategically locates data centers in distinct risk zones, ensuring a distance of at least **20** kilometers between them. Each data center is equipped with multiple redundant internet connections to safeguard against network disruptions and maintain uninterrupted service availability.

### Disaster Recovery

For disaster recovery purposes, productive HSM clusters (i.e., [CloudHSM Economy (ECO)](../Packages/economy)) replicate their data to an additional fortified data center housed within a former military bunker deep within the Swiss Alps. This facility, classified as EMS zone 2 (BSI) and NATO zone 3, offers exceptional resilience against natural disasters and extreme environmental conditions. The CloudHSM disaster recovery procedures are exclusively applicable to [service packages](../Packages/overview.md) with Disaster Recovery site setup, ensuring comprehensive protection against unforeseen events.
