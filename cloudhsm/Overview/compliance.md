# Compliance

Securosys CloudHSM is powered by physical Hardware Security Modules (HSMs), specifically _Primus HSM_, which have earned the certifications listed on this page.

For clusters in FIPS mode, Securosys CloudHSM provides FIPS-approved HSMs that meet FIPS-2 Level 3 compliance requirements. Customers also have the option to choose clusters that are non-FIPS mode. For details on what certification and compliance requirements apply to each, review the different [Service Packages](../Packages/overview.md).

**FIPS 140-2 Level 3**

Indicates that the HSMs have strong physical security, controlled access, and robust key management practices, making it suitable for protecting sensitive information in various applications.

- FIPS 140-2 Level 3 - [Certificate #4583](https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/cryptographic-module-validation-program/certificate/4583) / [Certificate #3430](https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/cryptographic-module-validation-program/certificate/3430)
- FIPS 140-3 (Certification in progress) - View the [Implementation Under Test List](https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/cryptographic-module-validation-program/modules-in-process/iut-list)

**Cryptographic Algorithm Validation Program (CAVP)**

Indicates that the [algorithms and functions](./Supported_Algorithms_and_Functions.md) meet stringent security standards, verifying their ability to securely handle encryption, key management, and other cryptographic operations in compliance with federal regulations.
