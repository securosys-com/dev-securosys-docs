# Deploying Certificate Templates

As a starting point, Microsoft AD CS (Enterprise CA) provides several certificate templates, stored in Active Directory. These templates predefine common properties to apply (e.g. CNG provider, key length, validity, auto-enrollment, etc.) and are also used to define the enrollment policy on the CA.

An **Enterprise CA** can only issue certificates based upon the templates it is configured to use. When requesting a certificate, a client can just specify the template name in the request and the CA will build the certificate based upon the requestorâ€™s information in Active Directory and the properties defined in the template. Version 3 templates are required to support the CNG (HSM). 

Once the CA infrastructure ready, continue by adapting and deploying the essential certificate templates.

## Modifying the Certificate Request Templates

- On the subordinate CA server, open the CA console (certsrv), right-click Certificate Templates and select Manage.

- Choose your target template, right-click and select **`Duplicate Template`**. Modify the definitions according your needs (**`Compatibility`**, **`General settings`**, **`Cryptography`**). The following is a sample template definition, using Securosys HSM as Key Storage Provider. 

:::note
CNG requires compatibility settings for at least Windows Server 2016 or higher.

- Then publish the modified templates for issuing certificates. This is done from Certificate Templates folder of CA console. Right-click **`Certificate Templates`**, click **`Certificate Template to Issue`** and select the templates to publish, then click **`OK`**. The steps are depicted below:
