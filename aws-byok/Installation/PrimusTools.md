# Primus Tools Installation

There are many platform specific tools to handle HSM key stores and certificate procedures (e.g.OpenSC/pkcs11-tool, p11tool, Java keytool, Windows certutil, etc.). Additionally, Securosys developed the Primus Tools collection (`primus-tools.jar`) which provides a Java-based platform independent tool for Primus HSM or CloudHSM to perform the most common HSM key handling procedures via JCE Provider API. 

Download the latest Primus Tools collection `PrimusHSM_PrimusTools-Vx.y.z.zip` from the [Download](/primus-tools/downloads) section.

Usage of this tool requires previous installation of Java Runtime Environment (see [Primus Tools - Prerequisites](/primus-tools/Installation/Prerequisites).

For more details on the Primus Tools installation, configuration and usage please refer to [Primus Tools](/primus-tools/overview).
