<li>The term of the agreement, unless specified differently in the Order Form, is in minimum twelve (12) months, and unless terminated, the Agreement is automatically extended by twelve (12) months.

Shorter periods are possible against additional fee. There shall be no refund for one-time license fees; recurring license fees (subscription fees) are due until the effective date of termination (i.e., the expiration of the notice period), unless Subscriber terminates this Agreement for cause due to breach of contract by Securosys or according to Section 6.6 due to Securosys changes.</li>
<li>Either party may terminate this Agreement with twenty (20) days’ notice on any month end if: (i) the other party is notified in writing that it is in material breach of the terms or conditions of this Agreement; (ii) such party does not remedy such breach within thirty (30) days following such notice.

<li>Although Securosys may offer the service temporarily free-of-charge, Securosys may cease any free-of-charge access to the Platform at any time.</li>
<li>The features of the Platform and the Securosys policies may be enhanced and may be adapted by Securosys to reflect technical advances and to allow for the Platform’s continuing compliance with applicable mandatory law (whereas such enhancements/adaptation shall not materially reduce the quality or quantity of the Platform or the Service nor add material obligations to the Subscriber) (“Continuous Modification”). Securosys will provide information about Continuous Modifications within a reasonable period of notice (in general 6 weeks before the change is scheduled to take effect). This change notice will be issued by email. In the event that a change may negatively affect the justified interests of Subscriber so that Subscriber can no longer reasonably be expected to adhere to the agreements in the order form, Subscriber may terminate the affected cloud service in writing with a notice period of one month until one month after the announced change became effective.</li>
<li>Upon termination of this Agreement, Subscriber’s remote access right to the Platform and Subscriber’s right to the Use of the Licensed Material shall cease without undue delay.

In the latter event, they remain subject to confidentiality and have to be deleted in the regular back-up cycles. Subscriber shall inform Securosys upon Securosys’ written request about such deletion. If Subscriber does not comply with this deletion obligation or if Subscriber accesses the Platform and/or uses the Licensed Material after termination of the Agreement, Securosys shall be entitled to continue invoicing any recurring fees.

<li>Subscriber shall be liable for any interest on overdue payments under this Agreement commencing on the date such payment becomes due. The annual interest rate shall be five per cent (5%) per year.</li>

<ol>
<li>Subject as is set out below, Securosys may at its discretion adjust the recurring fees with effect from the start of a renewal term by giving three months’ written notice of the fee adjustment to Subscriber:</li>
<li>The fee change has to be agreed by the parties if the cloud service is renewed automatically for the renewal period unless Subscriber terminates the contract with effect at the expiration of the contractual term, by giving written notice at least one month prior to the expiration date of the preceding contractual term.

<ol>
<li>Securosys warrants the Service set forth in Appendix I and II.</li>
<li>Securosys actively monitors the market with regard to (security) vulnerabilities and threats to its Licensed Material that become known. If such vulnerabilities/threats become known, Securosys takes the necessary measures without undue delay to close these vulnerabilities and prevent security threats. Securosys further proactively informs Subscriber of the vulnerabilities/threats as soon as they become known, so that Subscriber can assess the corresponding risk and immediately provide Subscriber with the measures taken to prevent them (in particular bug fixes and updates) without additional cost.</li>
<li>Subject to a delivery of the Licensed Material without warranty (i.e., trial versions, free-of-charge Platform access), Securosys warrants that the Platform meets the specification in the Documentation at the time of conclusion of this Agreement.</li>
<li>Subscriber undertakes to test the Licensed Material prior to any productive use. Subscriber acknowledges and agrees that after termination of this Agreement any remote access to the servers of Securosys shall cease. Securosys will delete data, content and information transmitted to the Service after termination of this Agreement upon written cancellation order. In case Subscriber does not provide a cancellation order Securosys will send two reminders with a grace period of 10 days each before deleting the data. Securosys may charge reasonable fees for the storage of Subscribers data, content and information beyond the termination of the Agreement.</li>
<li>If after release of new Software Subscriber detects and informs Securosys in writing by means of a support ticket of a programming error of the Software or if Securosys becomes aware otherwise of such error, Securosys shall correct such programming error within due time (of at least thirty (30) days) and, in Securosys’ sole discretion, consist of debugging, instructions to avoid the programming error (whereas such work-around shall only be a temporary solution and does not relief Securosys from its obligation to fix the error), or provision of new Software that is error free but still complies with all contractually agreed requirements. If despite two (2) rounds of efforts by Securosys the programming error cannot be corrected and if the usability of the Software compared to the Documentation is severely impaired or impossible, then Subscriber shall set another grace period to correct the programming error, upon which unsuccessful expiry Subscriber may terminate the Agreement. The remuneration shall then be reimbursed by Securosys to Subscriber from the moment of the error reporting until the end of the prepaid Subscription period, after which the Subscriber shall have no access anymore to the Licensed Material.</li>
<li>This warranty shall be voided if the Subscriber misuses the Licensed Material or modifies the Licensed Material without authorization and this modification impacts the causes the error.</li>
<li>This warranty shall be voided to the extent that Securosys is not responsible for the programming error.</li>

<ol>
<li>To the best of its knowledge, Securosys represents and warrants that Licensed Material (including its Documentation) does not infringe the rights of any third party.</li>
<li>In the event of a third-party right infringement claim against the Licensed Material, Securosys shall defend Subscriber against such claim at its expense and pay all costs, damages, and attorney’s fees up to an amount that a court finally awards or that are included in a settlement approved by Securosys (further damages are reimbursed capped on the limitation of liability according to Section 11), provided that Subscriber:<!-- -->
<ol>
<li>without undue delay notifies Securosys in writing by registered mail of the claim; and</li>
<li>allows Securosys to control and reasonably cooperates with Securosys in the defense and any related settlement negotiations.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>If such a third-party claim is made, or appears likely to be made, Subscriber agrees to permit Securosys to enable Subscriber to continue to use the Licensed Material or to modify it or to replace it with Licensed Material that is at least functionally equivalent but non-infringing. If Securosys determines that none of these alternatives is reasonably available, Subscriber agrees to return the Licensed Material to Securosys upon written request. Securosys shall then issue Subscriber a credit equal to the amount paid by Subscriber for the Licensed Material for the current contract year.</li>
<li>This remedy is Securosys’ entire obligation to Subscriber regarding any infringement claim.</li>
<li>To the extent the modification of the Platform by Subscriber causes the infringement, the indemnification above shall be void.</li>

Securosys is also permitted to assign its rights to payments under this Agreement without obtaining the contracting Party’s consent.</li>

<li>To the extent permitted by applicable law, except for claims arising out of Sections 5, 7 and/or 8, neither Party may bring an action arising out of this Agreement, regardless of form, more than one (1) year after the cause of action has accrued.</li>
<li>Any rights and obligations, which by their nature survive and continue after the expiration or termination of this Agreement, shall survive, and continue, and shall bind the Parties and their successors and assigns, until such obligations are fulfilled.</li>
<li>This Agreement may only be amended by a writing signed by authorized representatives of the Parties.</li>
<li>If any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable, the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions will in no way be affected or impaired as long as the intent of the parties can be preserved. In such cases, both Parties undertake to replace the invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision with another valid, legal, and enforceable regulation. The same principle applies to open terms or omissions.</li>
<li>This Agreement is governed by Swiss law, without regard to the conflict of law provisions. The United Nations’ Convention on International Sales of Goods of 11 April 1980 (SR 0.221.211.1) does not apply.</li>
