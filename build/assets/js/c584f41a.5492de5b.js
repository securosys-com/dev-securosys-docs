Use AWS KMS to encrypt data across your AWS workloads, digitally sign data, encrypt within your applications using AWS Encryption SDK, and generate and verify message authentication codes (MACs). AWS KMS uses hardware security modules (HSM) to protect and validate your AWS KMS keys.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"Quickstart":{"id":"Quickstart","title":"Getting started with BYOK for AWS","description":"The process described in this document allows maintaining ownership and management over your KMS keys and to generate them using entropy in a safe environment within the Securosys Hardware Security Module as well as maintain a secure copy for disaster recovery scenarios.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"Tutorials/Create-key-HSM":{"id":"Tutorials/Create-key-HSM","title":"AWS BYOK - How to create a key on the HSM","description":"It is necessary to generate a key on the HSM which will be imported to the AWS KMS.
